# [Flappy Bird]
The premise of Flappy Bird's endless runner game is simple: Tap the screen to navigate an 8-bit bird character named Faby through the gaps between green pipes without hitting them. The seemingly simple mobile game resonated with millions of players worldwide and gained 90 million downloads at its zenith.
Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create the game loop, create a jframe and jpanel, draw images on the jpanel, add click handlers to make the flappy bird jump, randomly generate pipes and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the flappy bird and each pipe, and add a running score.
